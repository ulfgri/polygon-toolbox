- changed 'polycw' to always return a cell array, because
  it's a terrible idea to have a function return different types.
- better handling of empty polygons in the returned polygons. Now
  properly returns an empty matrix.

July 16, 2019; Ulf GRIESMANN
- fixed bugs in polyinters.c
- also return the polygon segments on which intersections
  are found
- renamed to polygon-toolbox

July 15, 2019
- Improved help text for 'polybool': emphasize that the arguments
  polygons are assumed to be closed polygons

October 15, 2018; Ulf Griesmann
- fixed a bug in 'polycentr.c'
- improved numerical test for equality in 'polyarea.c' and 'polycentr.c'
- nicer formatting in 'polybool.m'

October 05, 2018; Ulf Griesmann
- fixed a bug in 'iscwmex.c'

September 14, 2018; Ulf Griesmann
- at long last got 'polyarea' to work. Now
  both cases of polygons in which the last vertex
  is identical to the first ("closed") and polygons
  in which they are not ("open") are handled correctly.
- fixed corresponding bugs in the 'polycentr' function.
- new function 'polyinters' calculates line intersections 
  of the segments of two polygons.

February 21, 2017; Ulf Griesmann
- bug fix in 'poly_area.c'. Incorrectly calculated
  area of polygons with last vertex == first vertex
  (The error in 'polyarea' was first pointed out
  to me by Chris dijkbgf@gmail.com)

November 24, 2016; Ulf Griesmann
- update clipper library to version 6.4
- add functions 'polyarea' and 'polycentr'.

September 2, 2014; Ulf Griesmann
- version 23
- fix a small error in the help text
- cast arguments mx* functions to mwSize and mwIndex as
  needed to make function 64-bit proof.

August 30, 2014; Ulf Griesmann
- version 22
- this version is based on the Clipper library
  by Angus Johnson.

June 5, 2014; Ulf Griesmann
- version 21
- update to recently released version 2.33 of the GPC library
- various cleanups
